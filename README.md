# Report Automation

### Project Summary
Automate the organized monthly traffic report for an ad placement each week through an existing report.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to save time because we have to tell our partner how many impressions for the specific ad placement we need each day and week. Although we have an existing sheet that includes how many impression we need for each ad placement, it is confidential information and it is also time consuming if we upadte the information on a sheet each day. Therefore, we use the automation report to save our efforts and time.

### Data
Existing Report (ad placement, sales, campaign, period, daily traffic, date)

This report will be created automatically each week and it will update the needed daily traffic for the current month as well as the incoming month. No one has to edit it, saving us two hrs each month.
