# Report Automation

### Project Summary
Automate the organized monthly traffic report for an ad placement weekly through a booking spreadsheet.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to save time because we have to tell our partner how many impressions for a specific ad placement we need each day and week. Although we have an existing sheet that includes how many impressions we need for each ad placement, it is confidential information. It is also time-consuming if we update the information on a sheet each day. Thus, we use an automation report to save our efforts and time.

### Data
Existing spreadsheet (ad placement, sales, campaign, period, daily traffic, date)

### Result

This report will be created automatically and the needed daily traffic will be updated for the current month as well as the incoming month, saving us two hrs each week.
